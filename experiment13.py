# Step 1: Import the threading module
import threading

# Step 2: Define the first task
def task1():
    # Print messages to show that Task 1 is running
    for i in range(1, 4):
        print("Task 1 - Counting:", i)

# Step 3: Define the second task
def task2():
    # Print messages to show that Task 2 is running
    for i in range(1, 4):
        print("Task 2 - Counting:", i)

# Step 4: Define the third task
def task3():
    # Print messages to show that Task 3 is running
    for i in range(1, 4):
        print("Task 3 - Counting:", i)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Step 5: Create separate threads for the three tasks
    t1 = threading.Thread(target=task1)
    t2 = threading.Thread(target=task2)
    t3 = threading.Thread(target=task3)

    # Step 6: Start all threads
    # start() allows each thread to begin execution concurrently.
    t1.start()
    t2.start()
    t3.start()

    # Step 7: Wait until all threads finish
    # join() prevents the main program from finishing too early.
    t1.join()
    t2.join()
    t3.join()

    # Step 8: Print the final message
    print("All tasks completed!")
